Non-empty data structures for Rust.

Other crates are more focused for a single data structure (e.g. `Vec` or `HashMap`).
The goal of this crate is to contain non-empty implementations for all commonly used data structures.

Of course, "all" is quite a lot. I intend to add to this as I need non-empty data structures.
If you need one, PRs are extremely welcome!
